## Purpose

This repository is the single source of truth for documentation standards across all Core Red projects.

The standards defined here are **normative**. They are not guidelines, suggestions, or aspirational goals. They are mandatory requirements that govern how documentation is written, structured, and maintained within every Core Red repository.

## Authority

No project-level documentation may contradict the standards defined in this repository.

Projects **may** extend these standards to address domain-specific requirements. Extensions **must not** weaken, override, or reinterpret any standard established here. In the event of conflict between a project-level document and this repository, this repository prevails.

## Scope

These standards apply to:

- All public repositories under the Core Red organization
- All private repositories under the Core Red organization
- All documentation artifacts produced within Core Red projects

This includes, but is not limited to: README files, security policies, contributing guides, architecture documents, configuration references, and any file whose purpose is to communicate project information to an internal or external audience.

## Principles

**Documentation is product.**
It is not an afterthought, a supplementary artifact, or a secondary deliverable. Documentation ships with the code and is held to the same standard of quality, accuracy, and review.

**Clarity is non-negotiable.**
Every statement **must** be precise and unambiguous. Conciseness is valued, but never at the cost of completeness or correctness.

**Consistency is mandatory.**
All Core Red documentation **must** be structurally and tonally uniform. Deviation introduces ambiguity. Ambiguity is a defect.

**Standards evolve; they do not destabilize.**
Changes to these standards follow a controlled, versioned process. No standard is modified without justification, review, and explicit version increment.

## Compliance

All Core Red projects **must** comply with the mandatory standards defined in this repository. Compliance is assessed at the repository level.

A project is non-compliant if any of the following conditions are true:

- A mandatory document is absent
- A mandatory document deviates from its corresponding standard in structure, tone, or content
- Any documentation artifact contradicts the tone, terminology, or formatting rules defined here

Non-compliance **must** be resolved before release.

## Versioning

These standards are versioned under semantic versioning. The current version is defined in [STANDARD_VERSION.md](STANDARD_VERSION.md).

All Core Red projects **must** reference the version of the standards they implement.
