# Standard Version

## Current Version

**v1.0**

## Release Date

2026-02-06

## Scope of Applicability

This version applies to all Core Red repositories, public and private, and to all documentation artifacts produced within those repositories.

All projects created after the release date of this version **must** comply with the standards defined herein.

Existing projects **must** achieve compliance within a timeframe determined on a per-project basis, not to exceed 90 days from the release date.

## Stability Expectations

v1.0 is a stable release. All standards defined under this version are considered final for their stated scope.

**Minor revisions** (v1.x) may introduce:

- Clarifications to existing requirements
- Corrections of errors or inconsistencies
- Additions that do not alter existing requirements

Compliant documentation will remain compliant after a minor revision. No migration is required.

**Major revisions** (v2.0+) may introduce:

- Breaking changes to existing standards
- Restructuring of standard categories
- Removal or replacement of existing requirements

Breaking changes will include advance notice and a documented migration path.

## Change Philosophy

Standards evolve to reflect operational experience and identified deficiencies. They do not change to accommodate preference, trend, or convenience.

Every modification **must** satisfy at least one of the following criteria:

- It resolves an identified ambiguity in a current standard
- It corrects a factual or structural error
- It addresses a gap that has caused measurable inconsistency across projects

No change is introduced without:

- A version increment
- Documentation of the change rationale
- A defined effective date

Stability is a design goal. The authority of the standards depends on their predictability. Frequent or unnecessary changes erode that authority.
